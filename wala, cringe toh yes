I've fallen for your mixed signals, and how you genuinely validate my feelings, especially during our small talks. I feel so happy tuwing nag uusap tayo kaht di gaano katagal Just like what I said before, please don't be too soft-spoken because it's easy for me to get attached. pero wala eh that's just the way you are, so I'll be the one to step back. Don't worry, ako na mismo kusang iiwas. Kase kaibigan lang turing mo sakin while me sobra pa sa kaibigan turing ko sayo."")
